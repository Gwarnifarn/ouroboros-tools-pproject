General acknowledgments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Thank you Open Source community for all the great packages and tools you
provide! I use a lot of them in the ocp-tool and also in my daily workflow.
See :ref:`third_packages_label` for details about these projects.

Also a big THANK YOU to my parents for their love and help in any situation
(they also sponsored a new laptop when my old one broke during development of
this tool)! I love you!

Finally I want to send greetings and the biggest thanks to the best sister in
the world.
